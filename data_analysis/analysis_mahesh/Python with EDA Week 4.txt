EDA 
Data Understanding and data structure 
NAN === Not A Number -- Blank 

NAN / NULL 

Percentile: 

Percentile always talks about the Position: 

Position === Percentile * ( Total Number of values + 1) 

Total Number of values!! for the Age column is 1950 

It will arrange the data either in Ascending or Descending Order 

25% === 

0.25 * (1950 +1) 
0.25 * 1951 = 487.75
487th and 488th  position


0.5 * 1951  = 975.5 
975 and 976 

0.75 * 1951 = 1463.25
1463 and 1464 

Min  == 18 
Max == 59 
25% == 28 
50% == 39 
75% == 49 

Position = Percentile * (Total Number of Values + 1) 

Total number of values for the Height Column === 2000

Height Column Stats

Max = 197

Min = 136 

25% =  0.25(2001) = 500.25
500 and 501 ====== 163 

50% = 0.5(2001) = 1000.5
1000 and 1001 ===== 169 


75%  = 0.75(2001) = 1500.75
1500 and 1501 ==== 176

It will arrange the data in the ASCENDING ORDER!!!!! 

Exercise === what is the value of the 90th percentile for the Height Column === 182 

In Calories_Burned column what is the value of 25th Percentile? 

0.25 * (2001) 

222.28
223.07

222.675 is the 25th percentile value for the Calories_Burned column


Steps_per_Day
 
Min
Max
mean
median


25th, 50th, 75th percentiles values for the Heart_Rate column 

Age in to groups 

<25 Child 
<60 Adult
Senior 



BMI Calculations 

(Weight in kgs) / (Height in m)^2 

<18.5 === Underweight
 <25 === Normal
<30 == Overweight 
Obese 


There is Jar of chocolates!!!! Eclares!!!! Candy!!! Fruity !!! Cadbury!!!!

4 Types!!!! 

4 chocolates!!!! 
 --- Mulitiple 

If I ask you to segregate the columns!!!! 

Eclares --- 70 
Candy -- 25
Fruit -- 10
Cadbury -- 50 

Total --- 135 

if I want to draw the bars!!!!

Strug's rule 

1 + log2(N) 

1 + log2(2000)

Default bins based upon your data!!!!!

Total number of variables or Observation or Entities!!!! 

By default histogram will generate 10 bins!!!!! 

For Categorical data --- histogram is not appropriate ---- Bar plot ---- It is hard to find the values

Count plot 

HISTOGRAM is best suited for the NUMERICAL VARIABLES!!!! --- Distribution of the data!!!!

BAR PLOT is best suited for the Cetgorical Variables!!!!  --- Count of the Categorical Variables!!!! 



Matplotlib is used for the Basic Visuals

To get the advanced -- -Seaborn 

You can see the Histogram in Matplotbit as well as in Seaborn

When someone ask you to see the distribution of the data!!!! ---- Histogram from the MATPLOTLIB
Plt.hist  with bars 

Whenone ask you to plot BOX PLOT to check for the Outliers ---- sns.blox plot 

When Someone ask you to perform the relationship between the variables --- Correction ---- Heatmap from the sns.heatmap 

When you will go for Line Chart!!!!!  when you have time series data!!!!! 


Correlation ---- Relationshiop between the variables!!!! 


Let's calcualte correlation: Steps_per_Day Calories_Burned



Sum((Xi - X Bar)^2  *  Sum((Yi - Y Bar)^2

Segration of the Numerical and Categorical Varaibles


Correlation will apply only on the NUMERICAL data ---It will not work on the Categorical Data 


The purpose to check is it will be helping for the Model Building in the Machine Learning


Tomorrow we will be working on the Guided project!!!!
