Code Modular 

before going to the python code / file in IDE 

Please go through the dataset in either CSV or EXCEL 

I want to segregate what are numerical and categorical columns 

position = percentile(total number of values + 1) 

0.25(Total values in respecttive columns + 1) 

countplot --- bars==== how many times the value is repeating!! 

when performing Visual do I need to import any of the packages? 

Matplotlib and Seaborn 

pip is used to Install the package in your IDE --- it is one time!!!!! 

You are installing an APP in your phone 

ICICI bank app ---- use n number of times!!! 

!pip install (Package name) 

already installed 

if you are connected with multiple dataframes or datasets!!!! 

Matplotlib -- 

sns.countplot(data = df, x = 'Experience_Level')

step 1: data = df
step 2: take the X-axis as df['Experince_Level']
Step3: it will count for the individual values 

correlation = df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).corr()
print(correlation) 

How is this project?
