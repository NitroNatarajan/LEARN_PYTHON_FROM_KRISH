Comparison operator ---- Boolean --- Either True or False

Bit-wise operator -- Interger ----- 1 2 3 4 5 6 



to compare two values, we use comparision operator and to combine conditions we use logical operator, likewise practically where exactly we use this bitwise check operator?

In order to check the data through BIT-WISE or BINARY wise data!!!!


I could understand a bit yes, but since I am from a non tech background, can you suggest some video or article I can use to understand this binary concept, since I have used arithmetic, conditional and comparison I can grasp the idea but not sure why Bitwise operator is used for and how

Go through the ARTICLE on the how BINARY Values are calculated!!!

Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero

If Num > 0 --- Positive
If num < 0 -- Negative
ELse ---0 

just a query, I know that integers can be negative, posititve or a zero

Like ...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ...

So why is that we are using float in this?

AND Operation === Multiplication

a = int(input("enter a number"))
b = int(input("enter a number"))
result = a if a>b else b

result = 34 if 34>54 else 54

Week 2 Day 1 

Loop Controls!!! 

Break statement -- it used to terminate the RUNNING loop 

Continue -- It is used to skip the currrent iteration of the loop 

num = 5 
1
2
3
4
5
6

Output will be 
1
2
3
4
6




For example!!!  

If you are travelling from Hyd to Delhi!!!! --- Without breakes (HALT or STOP ) will you travel. 

For Lunch
For Fuel
For Snacks
For tea

While is an Infinite loop!!!! untill and Unless the Condition is TRUE!!!!! 

In realtime!!!!! ---- 

Break!!!! --- Terminate the loop --- 

OTP Verification --- you will be having certain time limit!!!!!  you need to enter the OTP within 2 minutes!!!!!! ---- Break!!! 

Continue!!!!! -- When you are using the ATM PIN password!!!!! --- attempts!!!! to give a try!!! until and unless you enter the correct pin!!!!

Break!!! if you enter 3 times incorrect you need to contact the bank. 


String data!!!! --- Characters!!!! 

How string data is represented in Python in Quotes either in single or double quotes!!!

I want to retrive only Y letter from PYTHON? by using the concept called as "INDEXING" 

In Python --- INDEX always starts from 0 (ZERO) 


I'm learning Python

Total len == 19 

I can get the particular char in the string!!!! by using INDEXING concept!!!! SINGLE CHARACTER 

Positive Indexing !!!
Negative Indexing!!!!


"Python Programming"

[Start: Stop: Step] --- SLICING!!!!! breaking the data to get your approrpiate information or data


range(start: stop: step)


I'm leaning Python programming Language

I --  0 
' --- 1
m --- 2
 ---- 3
l -- 4 

"    Mahesh   " 
 As an exercise I want you ppl to make a document on the functions that we use in the STRING manipulations!!!!!

LIST!!!! ----- What do you understand by the term LIST!!!!! 

Collection of ELEMENTS 
Order of items

LIST is represented by [ ] SQUARE Brackets!!!! 

a = []

Properties of a LIST:

=== Elements in a list are in a ORDER
They are MUTABLE --- CHANGABLE!!!!! 
Dupliactes are allowed in the LIST
You can have any of the datatype in the LIST 

If you are going for a SUPERSTORE!!! when you go for Billing!!!! 

10 Items!!!! will the billing counter help you with One Consolated bill or 10 Individual bills? ----1 BILL with 10 Items!!!! 


Append means --- -Adding the data at the last!!!!! 

POP ---- It used to remove the last value
APPEND --- It is used to add the values in the last 


list1 = ['Sukanya',234, 34.65,'Data Science',True]

EXTEND --- The output will be also comma seperated!!!!!


Recap --- 

Loop Controls --- Break and Continue

Treminate the loop --- -Break
Skip the current iteration --- Continue

Data Structures of Python --- LIST

WHat is the Representation of a LIST === [ ]
Can I modify the elements in the list? ==== Yes === MUTABLE
Can I get the Index or the position of the element === =YES ---- INDEXING!!!! 
How many types of Indexing? 
2 types: 
1. Postitive indexing ---- starts from 0 
2. Negative Indexing ---- starts from -1 
We have seen Slicing!!!!
[start: stop: step]


SET!!!! 
Properties of Set: 
It is represented in { } -- FLOWER BRACKETS!!!!
SET is UNORDERED 
Duplicates are not allowed in the sets
we can't access the elements in the set by using indexing!!!! --- SET is UNORDERED 

It is used for the Mathematical set  theory ---- Union, Intersection etc.... 

When we use Append elements will be added at the end of the list 

List of groceries --- 10 items === consolidated [ ] or { } or ( ) 

[Fruits --- str
Shirt -- str
Dal -- float
Oil -- int 
Soaps] == =billing for single amount === int or float 



list allows the duplicates, ordered, and mutable it is. 
set  allows to store the collection of items but it doesnt be ordered but it allows the uniquecollection of different data.
is this right?

what is mutable? --- Changable or modify the  elements! 

If you want to remove specific element in the set  --- REMOVE
pop() -- It randomly remove the elements in the set 

Realtime examples!!!!! ---- When you are sign in your GMAIL account --- You will getting the option type of code for authentication 

AYB@IH# --- do you think when you refresh the characters all are fixed length? ----- Set!!!

Data Structure is Tuple!!!

Properties of Tuple: 

It is represented in ( ) --- Brackets!
It is IMMUTABLE --- Once it is created we can't make any modification or changes to it. 
It allows duplicates 
It supports Indexing!!!!! 

Example!!! --- Databases!!!! 

MYSQL WORKBENCH --- Once you create a Schema --- you can you Rename it? --- FIXED settings!!! 

You will generating the PIN -- ATM!!!!! ---- ICICI Bank ---- 4 digit ---  5 digit


range(0,10) 

0 to 9 -- -FIXED values!!! 


In LIST -- -We can make changes to the LIST --- Dynamic usage 
but in TUPLE -- ONCE it is created we can't make any changes to it.  -- Fixed usage

Just as a recap: 

SET!!!! -----I can Modify it 
Represented in { } 


TUPLES!!!!---- I can't modify it once it is created
Count and Index
representation of a Tuple --- ( ) 


Can I perform Indexing in the Tuples? ---- Yes!!!!

Dictionary is represented in {Key : Value} 

Properties!!! 

It is Mutable ---- I can Modify or change the data
It is Unordered  --- NO Specific Index 
Key : It has to UNIQUE -- Duplicates are not allowed  --- Key allows any of the datatype
Value: It can have duplicates -- allows any of the datatype

0 	25% 	50% 	75%  100% ==== Percentage 


Histogram ---- it takes about the distribution of the data 

X-axis ---- Data Points
Y -axis ---- Frequency or Count 

Bins are calculated using the Strugs rule!!! 

bins = 1 + log2(n) 
n --- no.of observations
